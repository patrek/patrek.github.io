= Azure (mes notes)

== Azure cli

```bash
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
```

== Azure data studio

install: https://azuredatastudio-update.azurewebsites.net/latest/linux-deb-x64/stable

```bash
sudo dpkg -i ./Downloads/azuredatastudio-linux-<version string>.deb
```
== Azure CLI Single Sign-On (SSO)

Yes, Azure provides a way to set up Single Sign-On (SSO) for command-line access using Azure CLI. You can authenticate using Azure Active Directory (AAD) to enable SSO. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

== Setting Up SSO for Azure CLI

To connect to Azure using SSO from the command line, follow these steps:

1. **Install Azure CLI**:
Ensure you have the Azure CLI installed. You can download it from the official Azure website.

```bash
   # For Windows
   https://aka.ms/installazurecliwindows

   # For macOS
   brew update && brew install azure-cli

   # For Linux
   curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
```

Login with Azure CLI: Use the following command to log in to Azure using your Azure Active Directory credentials:

```
az login
```

This command will open a web browser where you can enter your credentials. If your organization has SSO configured, you will be redirected to your organization's login page.
Use Device Code Login (Optional): If you are unable to use a web browser, you can use the device code login method:

```
az login --use-device-code
```

This command will provide a code and a URL. Open the URL in a web browser, enter the code, and complete the login process.
Set the Subscription (if necessary): If you have multiple subscriptions, you can set the active subscription using:

```
az account set --subscription "Your Subscription Name or ID"
```

Verify Login: To verify that you are logged in and to see your account details, use:

```
az account show
```
By following these steps, you can set up SSO for Azure CLI and connect from the command line using your Azure Active Directory credentials.


== High level description

Azure is a cloud computing platform and service created by Microsoft. It provides a wide range of cloud services, including those for computing, analytics, storage, and networking. Users can choose and configure these services to meet their specific needs.

== Key Components of Azure

Azure offers various components that can be utilized to build and manage applications and services:

* **Virtual Machines (VMs)**: On-demand, scalable computing resources that allow you to run applications in the cloud.
* **Virtual Networks (VNet)**: A logically isolated network that enables you to securely connect Azure resources to each other and to on-premises networks.
* **Azure Storage**: A scalable cloud storage solution for data, files, and backups.
* **Azure App Services**: A platform for building, deploying, and scaling web apps and APIs.
* **Azure Functions**: A serverless compute service that allows you to run event-driven code without managing infrastructure.
* **Azure SQL Database**: A fully managed relational database service based on SQL Server.
* **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: A managed Kubernetes container orchestration service for deploying and managing containerized applications.

== Creating a Virtual Machine

To create a Virtual Machine in Azure, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. In the left-hand menu, select **Virtual Machines**.
3. Click on **+ Add** to create a new VM.
4. Fill in the required information:
   * **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription.
   * **Resource Group**: Choose an existing resource group or create a new one.
   * **Virtual Machine Name**: Enter a name for your VM.
   * **Region**: Select the Azure region where you want to deploy the VM.
   * **Image**: Choose the operating system image for your VM (e.g., Windows, Linux).
   * **Size**: Select the size of the VM based on your performance needs.
5. Configure additional settings as needed (e.g., networking, management, security).
6. Review your configuration and click **Create** to deploy the VM.

== Creating a Virtual Network

To create a Virtual Network in Azure, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
2. In the left-hand menu, select **Virtual Networks**.
3. Click on **+ Add** to create a new VNet.
4. Fill in the required information:
   * **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription.
   * **Resource Group**: Choose an existing resource group or create a new one.
   * **Name**: Enter a name for your VNet.
   * **Region**: Select the Azure region where you want to deploy the VNet.
   * **Address Space**: Define the IP address range for the VNet (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
5. Configure subnets as needed.
6. Review your configuration and click **Create** to deploy the VNet.

== Azure Equivalents of AWS Tools/Features

Azure provides various services that are equivalent to AWS tools and features. Below are the Azure equivalents for the specified AWS services:

* **Security Groups**:
  ** **Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs)**: NSGs are used to control inbound and outbound traffic to Azure resources. They allow you to define rules based on IP address, port, and protocol.

* **CloudFront**:
  ** **Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Azure CDN is a global content delivery network that caches content at strategically placed physical nodes to provide high availability and performance.

* **Load Balancers**:
  ** **Azure Load Balancer**: Azure Load Balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple virtual machines to ensure high availability and reliability.

* **ECS / Fargate**:
  ** **Azure Container Instances (ACI)**: ACI allows you to run containers without managing servers, similar to AWS Fargate.
  ** **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: For orchestrating containerized applications, AKS is the equivalent of AWS ECS.

* **RDS (Relational Database Service)**:
  ** **Azure SQL Database**: Azure SQL Database is a fully managed relational database service based on SQL Server.
  ** **Other Supported Databases**: Azure also supports other database services, including:
    *** **Azure Database for MySQL**
    *** **Azure Database for PostgreSQL**
    *** **Azure Database for MariaDB**
    *** **Azure Cosmos DB**: A fully managed NoSQL database service that supports multiple data models.

== Creating a Virtual Network and Network Security Group with Terraform

To create a Virtual Network (VNet) and an associated Network Security Group (NSG) in Azure using Terraform, you can use the following example configuration:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

# Create a Resource Group
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "East US"
}

# Create a Virtual Network
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
  name                = "example-vnet"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

# Create a Subnet
resource "azurerm_subnet" "example" {
  name                 = "example-subnet"
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.example.name
  address_prefixes     = ["10.0.1.0/24"]
}

# Create a Network Security Group
resource "azurerm_network_security_group" "example" {
  name                = "example-nsg"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  # Define security rules
  security_rule {
    name                       = "allow-ssh"
    priority                   = 100
    direction                  = "Inbound"
    access                     = "Allow"
    protocol                   = "Tcp"
    source_port_range          = "*"
    destination_port_range     = "22"
    source_address_prefix      = "*"
    destination_address_prefix = "*"
  }
}

# Associate the NSG with the Subnet
resource "azurerm_subnet_network_security_group_association" "example" {
  subnet_id                 = azurerm_subnet.example.id
  network_security_group_id = azurerm_network_security_group.example.id
}
```

== Explanation of the Configuration

Provider Block: Specifies the Azure provider.
Resource Group: Creates a resource group to contain the VNet and NSG.
Virtual Network: Defines the VNet with an address space.
Subnet: Creates a subnet within the VNet.
Network Security Group: Defines an NSG with a security rule to allow SSH traffic (port 22).
Subnet Association: Associates the NSG with the created subnet.
